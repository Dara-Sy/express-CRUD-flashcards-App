# HOMEWORK: EXPRESS REPS!!!!

Tonight, you will be practicing your Express learning so far by _retyping_ the wonderful movies app we've been building together for the past few weeks!!!! YAY!!!

In this repo you will find two express apps:
- `flashcards-app`: a full CRUD version of the movies app we've been building together for the past couple of weeks... with a twist. 🤔
- `my-flashcards-app`: A file structure that looks a _lot like_ the movies app we've been building together... but it's **totally blank**!!!!!

Your task is to **retype** the entire `flashcards-app` app into `my-flashcards-app`. (You can copy and paste the style.css and reset.css. And you don't need to include the migrations and seeds.)

It should also use the same database as something we've done earlier this week, so there should be no setup there.

### BEFORE YOU START!!!

[Do these wrist exercises!!!!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPO-zST-7EE) This is going to be _a lot of typing_.

### But whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy

Because it is _extremely important_ to get the muscle memory for building an express app down!

## 🚀 Completion looks like:

- Your `my-flashcards-app` has a working express app in it.
- Your working express app has been **thoroughly commented**.
- Any errors have been recorded in `errors.md`
- 🚨🚨 **IMPORTANT**!!! 🚨🚨 You have committed after finishing _each file_. A good commit history is _required_ for this homework to be considered complete.

## 🚀 Your homework submission should include:

- A pull request created on _this repo_.
- Completion, comfort, wins, losses, questions... you know the drill.

## This homework is due 🚨 11PM ON MONDAY NIGHT 🚨
